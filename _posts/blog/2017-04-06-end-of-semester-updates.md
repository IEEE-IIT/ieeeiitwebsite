<center><strong><span style="font-size:18px">Robosports Competition</span></strong></center>
Have you been looking for an opportunity to build a robot? Are you looking to have fun with friends while working to complete challenges? Interested in winning some prizes while enjoying free food? Just looking to try something new? If any of these apply, the Robosports Competition is for you!<br />
<br />
The Robosports Competition is a 24-hour event that challenges teams of students with up to five members to use supplied components to create a mini-robot capable of competing in sports-inspired challenges. Students of all majors are encouraged to participate, as resources and helpers will be present to guide those less familiar with microcontrollers, electronics, and other devices.<br />
<br />
The event will begin in LS 121 and LS 129 on Saturday, April 15th, at 12pm. There will be prizes for the winners, and food will be provided. However, space is limited. If you are interested, sign up as a team or individually as soon as possible. Individual registrants will be matched with a team.<strong> Registration ends on April 14th at 11:59pm. </strong><br />
